Microcontroller | Microprocessor
---------------| --------------
MCU contains a CPU, Memory, I/O all integrated into one chip | Microprocessor consists of only a Central Processing Unit
MCU uses an internal controlling bus | Microprocessor uses an external bus to interface to RAM, ROM, and other peripherals

# DEVLOPMENT BOARDS

> *Development board is basically a printed circuit board with circuitry and hardware on-board to facilitate experimentation with certain microcontrollers. These boards can save you from a lot of repetitive tasks*

* All the boards will fall into any of the below categories:
  * Microcontroller-based boards
  * System on Chip (SOC) boards
  * Single-board Computers (SBC)



> DEVELOPMENT BOARD FEATURES

- Power circuit          –   Generally set up to run off of a 9V power supply
- Programming interface  –   Let you program the microcontroller from a computer
- Basic input            –   Usually buttons
- Basic output           –   Usually LEDs
- I/O pins               –   Used for motors, temperature sensors, LCD screens, etc.
