Microcontroller | Microprocessor
---------------| --------------
MCU contains a CPU, Memory, I/O all integrated into one chip | Microprocessor consists of only a Central Processing Unit
MCU uses an internal controlling bus | Microprocessor uses an external bus to interface to RAM, ROM, and other peripherals
